## Description

.This is a game which the player need to eat the fruit,collect enough points  before the bomb kill you!
.use up, down, left, right arrow to control the player
. eat the food, collect the point and win the game!

.in this version, i fixed few bugs from the last variation. 
1) the mvoement of the bomb become more random, giving player a higher chance to survive. 
I gave it a 50/50 chance either it will move on the x direction or the y direction.it makes the bomb path more unstructure.
2) removed the tail behind the player.
3) i took off the numbers 0, cause they are really distracting the game expereince and it made the game inpossible to win.
